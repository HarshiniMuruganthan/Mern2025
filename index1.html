    <h4>
        Why it is printing undefined when giving (b.i) & giving the key for (i)
    </h4>
    <h5>
        The output is undefined because obj.key is looking for a property literally named "key"  in the object, instead of dynamically accessing the property using the value of the key variable.
    </h5>
    <h4>
        Difference between Spread and rest operator
    </h4>
    <h5>
        The spread operator expands elements of an array or object into individual components, while the rest operator gathers multiple elements into a single array or object, with the key difference being that spread is used for expanding and rest is used for collecting.
